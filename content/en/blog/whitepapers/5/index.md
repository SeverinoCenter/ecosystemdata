In 2021, [Clair Labs](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/clair-labs-targets-9m-seed-on-contactless-patient-monitoring/), a company focusing on remote healthcare technology, closed $9 million in seed funding to continue improving and developing its technology. Clair Labs was co-founded in 2018 by two Apple employees in hopes of targeting the aging population. The company took off by implementing at-home medical devices with low-acuity patients from hospitals. The technology replaces complicated medical devices and supplies the patients with something easier to use. 

Before closing on the seed funding, though, Clair Labs was a start up company developing new sleep apnea technology from Israel. By adopting this technology, the field is now open for more innovation, improvement, and investment. This means a company like Clair Labs can very much be started anywhere, especially in regions like Upstate New York where there are opportunities for startups and good jobs. 

For healthcare related businesses outside of the state, there are changing yet still robust opportunities for sales and investment in aging areas that are also regions with connections to higher education. In other words, for homegrown health-related startups, this means there are locally based opportunities to scale businesses in our backyard. 

Healthcare is a vital part of our daily lives as human beings. It is a necessity for disease prevention and mitigation and plays a major role in improving the quality of life amongst fellow citizens. Given the fact healthcare is never going away, it opens the door for further innovation and updated practice such as robotic surgeries, angioplasties, and skilled exercise prescription. 

However, this innovation is not always accepted and used as frequently as it should. [Telehealth](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0254.htm), for example, had a major breakthrough in society throughout the pandemic year. Before last year it was almost unheard of to have gone to an appointment on Zoom or a similar platform even though it was an existing practice years prior to the pandemic. 

Successful innovation stems from the customers themselves. This innovation is something they want and will use daily that aids in improving upon the previously established base. Strong innovation that is accepted into healthcare will allow small businesses and startups to thrive. Within the aging population, [“three fourths of older adults prefer to live in their homes for as long as possible”](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/eldercare-senior-home-care-startups-funding/) opening the door to investors and small businesses to create and fund these services to comply with the customers needs. 

Often in hospitals, patients need to be woken up in the middle of the night to assess their vitals. An artificial intelligence tool that [Northwell Health’s research](https://www.inc.com/amrita-khalid/northwell-health-michael-dowling.html) recently developed an arm that can determine whether or not the patient actually needs to be woken up for this. By accepting this into hospitals across New York State, the patient's time in the hospital could be less traumatic. 

Since healthcare is necessary and innovation is not going away anytime soon, New York State appears to be promising for healthcare startups that are looking to make the connection between sales success and their location. 

Throughout this analysis, seven different metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) throughout New York State are examined to determine what type of healthcare businesses are thriving in that area and their potential for innovation. This review explores the need for funding within small businesses and startups to put them on track for a successful future to compete with the larger organizations and businesses within the healthcare field. 

### RESEARCH APPROACH/METHODOLOGY

The purpose of this analysis was to uncover the connection between businesses throughout Upstate New York and their sales potential. Each business is classified by the [North American Industry Classification System](https://www.naics.com/frequently-asked-questions/#NAICSfaq) (NAICS) code, which is a standard practice used by federal statistical agencies to classify businesses. These classified businesses are then used for the “collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data [that is] directly related to the business economy of the U.S.” 

This analysis focuses on healthcare, specifically ambulatory healthcare businesses, hospitals, and nursing and residential care facilities. Once the businesses are classified by their NAICS code, they are then split throughout New York State into metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), which are created according to the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about.html) data and encompass “a core area containing a substantial population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration.” 

This study focuses on seven major MSAs throughout New York State. The MSA areas are Buffalo, (assigned to number one within the analysis); Rochester (two); Albany- Troy- Schenectady (three); Syracuse (four); Utica (five); Binghamton (six);  and Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown (seven) which utilizes the surrounding areas of Dutchess County and Orange County. 

The data included within this analysis contains 3,584 health-care businesses split up into the seven different MSAs. The analysis also included the businesses sales bracket, their per capita and NAICS code. There are 20 total sales brackets ranging from $1-$ 500 million. These were then divided into four main clusters containing five sales brackets each. Cluster one ranged from $1-$3.99 million, cluster two included $4-$19.99 million, cluster three encompasses sales brackets ranging from $20-$74.99 million and finally cluster four includes $75-$500 million. 

Ambulatory healthcare businesses are classified under NAICS code 621, hospitals are assigned NAICS code 622, and nursing and residential care facilities are designated NAICS code 623. Throughout the analysis the NAICS codes were used in the algorithm to determine if the type of business had an impact on the location and sales potential. Including this variable helped differentiate the sales brackets of hospitals and ambulatory healthcare businesses since there is a large gap between $1 million and $100 million dollars. 

### THE RESULTS

The classification algorithms within this analysis are performing at an accuracy of about 83 percent, meaning that there is a direct relation between the businesses location and their sales potential. The algorithm took into account the businesses sale cluster, their NAICS code, the type of businesses they are, and the per capita for the MSA region. 

The algorithm itself will aid in the prediction of businesses within these seven MSAs sales potential for the upcoming year based on their location, what type of business they are, and their per capita. By including the per capita for each MSA it will flatten out the population. This was a necessary variable because the Buffalo MSA, per capita 11.25, is significantly larger than the Binghamton MSA, per capita of 2.37. 

Figure 1 displays a heatmap showing the relationship between each variable that was included within the analysis. The MSA variable and the per capita for that region has a strong negative correlation of -.97. This means as one of the variables goes up, the other goes down which makes sense because the larger MSAs are assigned to lower numbers in the analysis. 

Likewise, another unique finding was the relationship between the sales clusters and the MSAs. These variables had a negative correlation of -.057 which is statistically a very weak relationship. This is to be expected because within the sales clusters, there is a major difference in a business making $20 million and $74.99 million within a year. Eighty three percent of the businesses included within this analysis lie within the first sales cluster which ranges from $1 to $3.99 million which could skew this relationship.

In addition to that weak correlation, another very weak positive correlation is the sales clusters and per capita, however, this is similar to the last reasoning. If the sales clusters were broken down even further in attempts to combat this, dimensionality (the number of variables included within the analysis) became an issue within the algorithm. Having low relationships between the variables rule out any chance of having multicollinearity present throughout the analysis. [Multicollinearity](https://towardsdatascience.com/multicollinearity-in-data-science-c5f6c0fe6edf) occurs when the independent variables in the model are related to one another. Overall, it can reduce the efficiency of the classification algorithm and lead to an underfit model. 

### Rochester is Prime for Aging-Related Startups and Sales

Rochester is known as a prime area for hospitals. [Strong Memorial Hospital](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/strong-memorial/about-us/history.aspx), for example, began as a 250-bed hospital for teaching 95 years ago. Since then, the hospital has grown to include a variety of facilities accompanied by a “broad spectrum of high-quality, advanced medical care.” Currently Strong Hospital accommodates over “39,000 annual admissions” and continues to innovate. Between the booming college towns and the established healthcare this area has had their foot in the healthcare industry for quite some time. 

However, recent data is showing that the market is leaning towards requiring innovation and investment within the aging population and their healthcare needs. The aging population in the United States is hitting the economy “like a ton of bricks” according to Gina Raimondo, the [U.S. commerce secretary](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/aging-population-hit-us-economy-like-ton-bricks-us-commerce-secretary-2021-07-12/). Currently, a large portion of the population throughout the United States is aging. [By 2030](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/aging-population-hit-us-economy-like-ton-bricks-us-commerce-secretary-2021-07-12/), 22 percent of the U.S will be 65 or older. 
 
With that being said, this opens the door for innovation and investment throughout New York State catering to the aging generation. 

The violin plot in Figure 2 below displays the NAICS codes and their MSA. The NAICS code 623, nursing and residential care facilities, has a mean, or an average, that lies on Rochester. This means that this MSA has a market for innovation and investment with the aging population. Innovation that includes [technology that is designed with the older population](https://www.thegerontechnologist.com/) in mind and easy to use is something that is desired in this MSA, such as an app that runs like FaceTime but is for doctors appointments.

Another desirable investment option that would benefit the older population is in home accessible care. Instead of entering residential facilities or nursing homes, more people like to stay in the comfort of their own home for as long as possible. By allowing in-home care to be easily accessible and accepted into the healthcare field as a new innovation, startup businesses within this market area will blossom.

The emergence of [Harmonize](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/harmonize), in 2019, recognized the acceleration of this startup opportunity and closed a Series A round for $ 10 million from Launchpad Digital Health. Harmonize is not the first in its discipline receiving funding; the investment targets artificial intelligence based remote health tools for high-risk patients and patients who are unfamiliar with technology, which mirrors the growth in Rochester.

For startups, this can be a sales market opportunity. For ecosystems in this region, this can create new opportunities for entrance into this space. This is important to note given the number of universities and hospitals in this region.

### What is Expected in the Future?

Throughout this paper the relationship between businesses location was assessed and deemed to have a strong correlation to their sales potential. The businesses MSA, sales bracket, per capita for the region, and NAICS code were all taken into account through the analysis.

Figure 3 displays each MSA and the corresponding density of the NAICS code within that area. Across the plot, NAICS code 621, or ambulatory healthcare businesses, is showing promise in each region having a similar density of .15. This shows that there is a steady market throughout New York for investment within ambulatory healthcare practices.

NAICS code 622, hospitals, appears to be dense in the Albany-Troy-Schenectady MSA, Rochester MSA, and the Buffalo MSA. Companies like Clair Labs, specializing in at-home accessible care would thrive here. However, hospitals seem to drop off throughout the Syracuse MSA, the Utica MSA, and the Binghamton MSA. To investors, these MSAs are in need of innovation to bring the existing hospitals up to speed with the other areas.

Nursing and residential care facilities, NAICS code 623, seem to have the highest density throughout the Rochester MSA. As previously mentioned, this MSA is a prime area right now for startups and sales dealing with the aging population. Two other blossoming areas for startups and sales within the aging baby boomer population are Buffalo and Albany-Troy-Schenectady. These MSAs have similar densities behind the Rochester density on Figure 3. Similar to hospitals, Syracuse, Utica, and Binghamton fall off when looking at the densities in Figure 3. Since these MSAs drop off in both, hospitals and nursing and residential care facilities, these areas might be a better location for investment and innovation within ambulatory healthcare.
