Digital, on-demand platform businesses have gained rapid growth in the past two decades. Platform businesses such as Uber, Postmates, TaskRabbit, and Mechanical Turk create online networks that enable a broad range of human activities while radically changing the way people work and create value in the economy. These emerging models of platform-enabled, peer-to-peer businesses are collectively referred to as the gig economy or the sharing economy, featured by four categories of work platforms: crowdwork platforms, transportation platforms, delivery or home task platforms, and online freelance platforms (Kalleberg & Dunn, 2016). With the disruption to existing industries, the rise of the gig economy raises important questions about its impact on the development of the regional economy. This research translation particularly focuses on its influence on local entrepreneurial activity. 

> Side 1: Gig platforms encourage entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with an income source along with flexible working hours.  

On the one hand, the entry of platform businesses into one region may promote local entrepreneurship, because entrepreneurs can utilize their time to earn stable income from gig jobs while enjoying the flexibility to manage their own projects. For example, studies such as Agrawal, Catalini, Goldfarb, and Luo (2018) and Voss Glenn, Sirdeshmukh, and Voss Zannie (2008) show that slack resources, which include both time and capital, play an important role in encouraging individuals to initiate high-quality and complex innovative projects. Shah and Tripsas (2007) additionally highlight that user entrepreneurship, which is defined as the commercialization of a new product or service by individuals who are also users of that product or service, often takes place by accident, particularly after entrepreneurs engage in collective creative activity within the social context. From this perspective, various novel gig-platform businesses are likely to bring inspiration to young entrepreneurs, as well as the opportunity to gain market experience. 

> Side 2: Gig platforms discourage entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with alternative job opportunities.

On the other hand, the entry of platform businesses may reduce entrepreneurial activity, because individuals who might be previously pursuing entrepreneurial projects are now attracted to alternative employment opportunities on gig platforms. Compared to entrepreneurial projects with high risk and pressure, gig-economy platforms offer a broad range of job categories with flexible working hours, as well as the autonomy that individuals would have as entrepreneurs. For highly skilled individuals such as software engineers, they can especially earn higher wages through gig jobs while improving their work-life balance. In addition, research including Congregado, Golpe, and Parker (2012) and Koellinger and Thurik (2012) suggest that many individuals indeed pursue entrepreneurship as a solution to unemployment or falling wages in their current jobs. Those would-be entrepreneurs are thus expected to be attracted to gig jobs rather than taking the risks of building successful businesses themselves. 

To investigate the aggregate impact of the gig economy on local entrepreneurship, Burtch, Carnahan, and Greenwood (2018) examine the entry of the ridesharing platform Uber X and subsequent crowdfunding campaigns launched on Kickstarter by regions. They observe that the entry of Uber X into a region leads to a significant decline in local entrepreneurial activity. Interestingly, the decline in entrepreneurial activity is primarily driven by a reduction in unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns, rather than successful ones. A significant finding is that gig-economy jobs can potentially serve to substitute for low-quality entrepreneurial projects and provide alternative employment opportunities to individuals who would have low potential as entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the study has important implications for efficiency of capital allocation in the crowdfunding market. Specifically, with much fewer low-quality campaigns on Kickstarter, investors who look for projects to fund incur a reduction in search costs, ultimately leading to more efficient capital allocation in the market (Shane, 2009). From the perspective of entrepreneurs, those who hold high-quality projects will certainly benefit from an increased likelihood of funding success on Kickstarter. The sooner those entrepreneurs receive funding, the sooner they can build their businesses and contribute to the local economy. 

In sum, the growing gig economy is causing radical changes to a wide range of human activities. Although the traditional view argues that digitalization always brings disruptive technology, the popularity of gig platforms may actually improve the overall quality of local entrepreneurial activity, specifically by providing alternative job opportunities to individuals who might otherwise have engaged in low-potential entrepreneurial projects.
