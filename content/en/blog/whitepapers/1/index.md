In the past decade, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular means by which entrepreneurs raise external financing for their innovative ideas. Compared to traditional fundraising through banks, angels, and venture capital, crowdfunding enables entrepreneurs to create campaigns online and collect money from a large audience (the “crowd”) via internet-based platforms. The fact that anyone can create a campaign on these platforms makes crowdfunding especially appealing to young entrepreneurs. However, building a successful crowdfunding campaign can be challenging. According to the world’s largest crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, the funding success rate for all the 532,118 campaigns launched on its platform (by August 2021) is 39%, with tech projects achieving the lowest success rate of only 21% . In addition, crowdfunding projects tend to succeed by small margins, or fail by large amounts. On Kickstarter, only 3% of failed campaigns raise 50% of their goals and only 25% of successful campaigns raise 3% over their goals (Mollick, 2014). Given the challenges in crowdfunding, entrepreneurs shall strategically design their campaigns and effectively communicate with potential investors to improve their funding performance.

> 1. Expand your social network size before launching your crowdfunding campaign.

Mollick (2014) examines the characteristics of campaigns on Kickstarter and finds that two key factors of funding success are signals of project quality and size of entrepreneurs’ social network. Specifically, signals of high-quality projects, including uploading a video, providing quick updates on funding performance, avoiding spelling errors in project pitches, being featured on Kickstarter home page, and having shorter fundraising duration (which signals greater confidence of founders), are all associated with a higher rate of funding success . Social network size of founders, measured by the number of their Facebook friends, is also positively associated with funding success. This is potentially because social networks of founders provide the initial source of significant funding (“friends and family” money) , connections to resource providers, and endorsements of project quality.

> 2. Build a coherent story for your business and be clear about your value proposition.

Particularly analyzing the information content of project pitches on Kickstarter, Allison, Davis, Webb, and Short (2017) find that both issue-relevant information and peripheral cues in entrepreneurial narratives enhance crowdfunding performance. Issue-relevant information refers to all credible evidence directly relating to the quality of projects, such as the education and functional experience of entrepreneurs and the usefulness of products. Peripheral cues, in contrast, refer to the remaining elements of a narrative that create the context. For instance, the empirical evidence shows that entrepreneurs who portray the venture as a personal dream to espouse group identity tend to achieve better funding performance. More interestingly, increase (decrease) in crowdfunding experience and funding commitment will strengthen the positive impact of issue-relevant information (peripheral cues) on funding performance. In a similar vein, Moss, Renko, Block, and Meyskens (2018) conduct content analysis to examine the value orientation of entrepreneurs on the prosocial crowdfunding platform, Kiva. They find that entrepreneurs who emphasize social value, through the use of words such as “community,” “responsibilities,” “humanity,” “equality,” “justice,” and “welfare,” taker a shorter period of time to achieve funding goals than entrepreneurs who emphasize economic value, featured by the words such as “cost-effective,” “money-saving,” and “turnover.” However, entrepreneurs who have a balanced positioning between social and economic value do not perform better than those who have a singular focus on one over the other.

> 3. Show passion and optimism in your pitches, but don’t be overconfident.

Besides analyzing entrepreneurial narratives, scholars have also applied facial recognition technology to understand how positive emotions displayed during funding pitches help entrepreneurs convince external investors. For instance, Jiang, Yin, and Liu (2019) capture the facial movements of entrepreneurs in 1,460 pitch videos on Kickstarter to investigate the impact of displayed level and duration of joy on funding performance. They find that the level of an entrepreneur’s peak displayed joy is positively related to the number of backers who pledge money and the total amount of funding pledged. However, the total length of time in which an entrepreneur displays joy at its peak level has an inverted U-shaped relationship with funding performance. In other words, peak time length has a positive impact on funding performance, but starts to harm the performance once beyond a certain duration. Research suggests that, when entrepreneurs spend too much time expressing joy, the audience perceive the entrepreneurs as overly optimistic and unprofessional, leading to less trust in the projects and thus less investment. 

In sum, successful fundraising on digital platforms requires entrepreneurs to strategically design and run their campaigns, in addition to having high-quality projects in the first place. Drawing valuable insights from the academic research on dynamics of crowdfunding may help entrepreneurs achieve better funding performance and ultimately build successful businesses.
