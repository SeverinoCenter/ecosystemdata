Inspired by Brad Feldâ€™s Startup Communities book and launching in 2022 with support from More Good Jobs author Martin Babinec and the UpMobility Foundation, Inc., this project will aim to become a research for startup communities throughout the world. By studying these communities and providing resources to policy makers and community builders, we can unlock the understanding of what it takes to create More Good Jobs in our communities.
